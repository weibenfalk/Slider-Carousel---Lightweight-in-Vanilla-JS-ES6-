# Slider-Carousel---Lightweight-in-Vanilla-JS-ES6-
A lightweight slider with ES6 syntax and CSS animations

There´s too many sliders out there that are great but have to many functions etc. 
I decided to do my own lightweight slider that´s independent and written completely in Vanilla JS ES6.

TODO: Implement some kind of navigation dots

I also tried out using the Flexbox for centering vertical and the "object-fit" in the CSS for covering.
It´s also possible to add an overlay text over the slides and be styled to your own likings.
